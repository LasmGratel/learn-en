# 虚拟语气

## 一般虚拟语气

还是上那个早都背烂了的表格吧。

时态 | 主句 | 从句 | 例子
---- | ---- | ---- | ----
现在时 | would/could/should/might (以下简称4) + do | did (be动词用were) | If I were you, I wouldn't go to that place.
过去时 | 4 + have done | had done | If I had been to Beijing, I would learn more about China.
将来时 | 4 + do | were to do / should do | If sun were disappeared, we wouldn't feel hot anymore. (即太阳消失的可能性很小)

## 省略if的倒装

当从句的谓语动词含有were，should，had时，if可以省略，并把were，should，had等词置于句首。

例如：

> Were she here，she would agree with us.
>
> 原句: She would agree with us if she were here.

## 省略should的虚拟语气

很多老师应该都让你们背过这样一段话

> 1坚持 2命令 3建议 4要求

其实就是insist(坚持), order, command(命令), suggest, advise, recommand(建议), ask, request, demand, required(要求)

当这些词语出现在虚拟语气当中是 _可以且通常省略_ should的。

例如:

> I insisted that he (should) stay.
>
> He suggested that we (should) leave early.

## Wish引导的虚拟语气

时态 | 结构 | 例子
---- | ---- | ----
现在时 | 主语 + wish that + did/were | I wish that he didn't smoke.
过去时 | 主语 + wish that + 4 + do | How I wish I could fly!
将来时 | 主语 + wish that + would/could + have/had done | I wish I could have my dream achieved one day.

## Given引导的虚拟语气

_在这里Given的意思是如果有.../假定..._

例如，一个普通的虚拟语气:

> If we give them time, they will probably finish the work.

可替换为:

> If they are given time, they will probably finish the work.(即先替换成被动语态)

进一步可替换为:

> Given time, they will probably finish the work.

注意两个句子主语必须一致。

## 注意: Unless

Unless可以与if not互换。

例如：

> You will miss the bus if you don't hurry up.

可替换为：

> You will miss the bus unless you hurry up.

但有时会出现不能互换的情况，这种情况的一种例子：

> They could **not** afford to live in such an expansive apartment unless they were rich.

在这句话中，主句为否定句，而if not引导的从句是不能再被主句否定的。// TODO 存疑
